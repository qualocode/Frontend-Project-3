            Without flukes, feeding is difficult: Gray whales need their tails
            as a propeller to navigate headfirst into the muddy seafloor and
            filter out small crustaceans. What's more, the species' lengthy
            migration from birthing grounds
          </p>
          <p>
            in Mexico to feeding grounds in the Arctic becomes extremely
            challenging without a tail to power their journey. (See "A Gray
            Whale Breaks the Record for the Longest Mammal Migration.")
            Flukeless mothers also can't defend their calves from killer whales.
            That said, Schulman-Janiger, a whale biologist who runs the American
            Cetacean Society's Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project, is
            fascinated by some animals' ability to adapt to their handicap.

          <p>
            The uptick in gray whale sightings is in line with a general
            increase in whale entanglements over the years. Between 2000 and
            2012, the number of such incidents averaged 10 per year, according
            to NOAA. In 2017, there were 31, Folkens says.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for the rise is unknown, though people might just be
            better at noticing them, says Folkens. But there are also more
            whales around to become entangled. Populations of grays, blues, and
            humpback whales have flourished in recent years, he says. Some
            entangled whales can be rescued—trained wildlife experts freed six
            of those 31 reported cases in 2017 on the U.S. West Coast, Folkens
            says—and a few break free on their own.
